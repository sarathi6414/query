            <summary>Why is the moon sometimes out during the day?</summary>
            <p>The Earth's daily revolution on its axis means that the Moon is actually above the horizon for about 12 hours out of every 24. Usually, some portion of that time will be during daylight â€“ you just need to look carefully, because its brightness is so much less than the Sun's.</p>

            <summary>Why is the sky blue?</summary>
            <p> Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.</p>

            <summary>How do airplane stay up?</summary>
            <p> Airplane wings are shaped to make air move faster over the top of the wing. When air moves faster, the pressure of the air decreases. So the pressure on the top of the wing is less than the pressure on the bottom of the wing. </p>
